          Rintaro Okabe (岡部 倫太郎 Okabe Rintarō?), often nicknamed Okarin, a portmanteau of the Oka- from his surname and the Rin- from his given name, is a self-proclaimed mad scientist and the main protagonist of the Steins;Gate series.
        </p>
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>
          Okabe has the characteristics of a lanky young man, with a square jaw and bony cheeks. He has his short black hair swept back and has brown irises, with a small amount of stubble on his chin and cheeks. Rintaro also wears a lab coat that reaches just below his knees, over a plain white T-shirt(light gray in the anime), and khaki-colored slacks. The breast pocket of his lab coat has a red pen sticking out, and around his slacks he wears a black military-style canvas belt, with a gold-colored buckle. He has dark socks and wears green slippers when inside the lab.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Steins;Gate 0, he is more professionally-dressed compared to his Steins;Gate counterpart, donning a black dress-shirt and slacks held by a black belt with a metal buckle. His hair is more neatly combed, likely to follow university standards. He no longer wears his signature lab coat.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the game, Okabe appeared much "dustier". His face was pale and unshaven and he seemed a lot more "messy" in contrast to his relatively "clean" appearance in the anime.
        </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          He and Itaru are both students of Tokyo Denki University, and have been friends for roughly three years, according to his words, although Itaru claims that their friendship is only about a year old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rintaro founded the "Future Gadget Laboratory", a small research institution situated above a CRT store. It is an area where he and his fellow Lab Members create "Future Gadgets for the betterment of mankind". He dubs himself Lab Member 001 (the first to join the lab).
        </p>
        <p>
          Rintaro has an enduring relationship with Shiina Mayuri - Lab Member 002 and co-founder of the "Future Gadget Lab", whom he made a vow to protect when they were young.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rintaro lives an average life with his small group of friends until he creates the Phone Microwave with Itaru.
